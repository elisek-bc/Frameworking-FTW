# Frameworks

This exercise was a hell of an exercise. I chose Bootstrap to work with, because I want to be able to use it later on, because a lot of companies work with this.

Getting divs into columns was easy, adding colors and margins and padding as well.
The navigation was very very difficult though. I can't get it how it needs to be.
