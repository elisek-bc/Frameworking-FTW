## Contributors

I, Elise, am the only contributor of this project.

## Timing

I worked on this exercise 11 and 12th of March. This was during my web development educational training at BeCode.

## What is it?

It's an example on how to use bootstrap. We needed to get as close as possible to an example, by only using bootstrap.

## Tools

This website was made with bootstrap CSS framework.

## Struggles

This exercise was a hell of an exercise. I chose Bootstrap to work with, because I want to be able to use it later on, because a lot of companies work with this.
Getting divs into columns was easy, adding colors and margins and padding as well.
The navigation was very very difficult though. I can't get it how it needs to be.
